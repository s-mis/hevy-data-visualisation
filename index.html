      <ul>
        <li class="descr"><strong>Objective:</strong> Help users optimize their workouts by providing insights into their progress over a one-year period.</li>
        <li class="descr"><strong>Radial bar chart section:</strong> Displays the number of sets performed each week, serving as a filter for further visualizations.</li>
        <li class="descr"><strong>Line charts:</strong> Three line charts illustrate the progression of estimated one rep max for deadlift, squat, and bench press exercises, tracking strength gains and identifying trends in performance.</li>
        <li class="descr"><strong>Polar area chart:</strong> Provides a quick overview of the distribution of sets among various muscle groups throughout the week.</li>
        <li class="descr"><strong>Horizontal bar chart:</strong> Displays the average Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) for five muscle groups: arms, back, chest, legs, and shoulders. 
          Each bar indicates the average RPE value for a specific muscle group during a chosen week. The desired goal is 8 and above, corresponding to training close (8 RPE = 2 reps in reserve) or until failure (10 RPE = no more reps possible).</li>
        <li class="descr">The color legend provides insights into the efficiency of each weekly or training cycle in the given charts.</li>
